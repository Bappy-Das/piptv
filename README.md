PIPTV - A simple Python IPTV client with 82 channels including NFL Network, ESPN, FS1 & FS2

This is an incredibly simple module.

USE:

At the prompt, you can immediately type the channel name you wish to stream, you can type **list** to see all
channels, or you can type **quit** to exit.

**NOTE:

I haven't tested this in a windows environment yet so I'm sure it will be a bit buggy.**

Enjoy!
